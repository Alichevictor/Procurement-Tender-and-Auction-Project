# Grandida_Project
This project captures the significant aim of achieving the needed transparency and fairness in Tender and Contract management systems across all bodies, using Blockchain Secure System.
The Dapp creates a contract instance where some addresses can create a tender and other addresses can bid for it.
The winner is selected by the owner of the tender
When the winner pays, the tender is marked as completed and a new tender can be created
You can view the bids and the winner
Only the owner of the tender(i.e: the person that created the tender ) can authorize the winner address.
